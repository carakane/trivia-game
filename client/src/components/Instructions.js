      <div>After you select "New Game" (above), the game will start. All 10 questions will appear on the page and you can answer them in any order you'd like. To answer a question, click on the "Ready to Answer" button and then select the correct option for whether you were right or wrong (no cheating!). After all 10 questions are answered you'll be able to see your final score, view the High Scores, or play again. Thanks for playing, and if you have any questions or problems, let us know!</div>
